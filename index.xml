      <description>In the foggy harbor, nestled amidst the whispering mist, stands an old and mysterious jellyfish shop known simply as &amp;ldquo;The Siren&amp;rsquo;s Glow.&amp;rdquo; Its dilapidated facade, weathered by time and the salty sea air, beckons intrepid explorers to uncover the secrets lurking within its enigmatic depths. As you approach, the air thickens with an eerie ambiance, an ethereal melody carried on the wind. The shop&amp;rsquo;s windows, obscured by layers of fog and the passage of years, give only tantalizing glimpses of the mystical wonders held within.</description>

      <description>This tutorial presents how to create an extension for Houdini that uses AI to analyze and document code, as well as generate it from the prompt. It also shows how to communicate with AI chat models (LLMs) endpoints in general.
It is inspired by the workshop conducted by Paul Ambrosiussen during EPC23.
Tool description We will create and add custom context menu buttons that will appear when we right-click on VEXpression and Python code fields in Houdini nodes.</description>
